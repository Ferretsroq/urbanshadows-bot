When you study a sanctuary, gathering spot, or place of power, roll with the Circle that controls it. On a hit, you see below the surface to the reality underneath; the MC will reveal an area, NPC, or item located within that is not what it seems. On a 10+, your insight reveals much about the Circle’s politics and schemes; ask the MC a question about the Circle and take +1 forward when acting on the answer.
