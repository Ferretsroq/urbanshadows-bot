When you take advantage of an opening to escape a situation, roll with BLOOD. On a hit, you get away and choose 1. On a 7-9, the MC chooses one as well:
         • you suffer harm during your escape
         • you end up in another dangerous situation
         • you leave something important behind
         • you owe an NPC a Debt for their aid
         • you give into your base nature and mark corruption
