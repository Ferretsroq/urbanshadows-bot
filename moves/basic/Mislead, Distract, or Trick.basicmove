When you try to mislead, distract, or trick someone, roll with MIND. On a hit, they are fooled, at least for a moment. On a 10+, pick 3. On a 7-9, pick 2:
         • you create an opportunity
         • you expose a weakness or flaw
         • you confuse them for some time
         • you avoid further entanglement
