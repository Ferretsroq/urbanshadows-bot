When you turn to violence, roll with BLOOD. On a hit, you inflict harm as established and your opposition chooses one:
         • they inflict harm on you
         • they put you in a bad spot
         • they create an opening to flee
On a 10+, you also choose one:
         • you inflict terrible harm
         • you take something from them
         • you create an opportunity for an ally
