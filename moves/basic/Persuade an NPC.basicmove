When you persuade an NPC with seduction, promises, or threats, roll with HEART. On a hit, they see your point and do as you ask. On a 7-9, they counter your offer or demand payment—a Debt, a favor, resources—before agreeing to follow through. If you cash in a Debt with the NPC before you roll, add +3 to your total.
