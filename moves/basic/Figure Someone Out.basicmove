When you try to figure someone out, roll with MIND.
On a hit, ask two. On a 7-9, they ask one of you as well. If you’re in their Circle, ask an additional question, even on a miss.
         • who’s pulling your character’s strings?
         • what’s your character’s beef with \_\_\_?
         • what’s your character hoping to get from \_\_\_?
         • what does your character worry is going to happen?
         • how could I get your character to \_\_\_?
         • how could I put your character in my Debt?
